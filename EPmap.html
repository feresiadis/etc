<p align="center">A mathematical precisation of the map is presented

For practical statistical methods of
estimation of the authoritarian degree etc. see the chapter V.B. <br/>
NB!
We usually have used &quot; , &quot;, the European standard instead
of American/UK standard, i.e. &quot; . &quot; as decimal separator.
The term &quot;ca&quot; is an abbreviation for the latin circa, which
means about or approximately.</p>

<p><b>The different systems on the map may be associated with
different colors and flags/banners</b>. The <b>colors </b>or
<b>flags/banners</b> associated to the map may be a useful
pedagogical tool, but of course are symbols that are less important
than statistical and mathematical analysis, scientifically seen. And
the use of colors/flags in mapping of political tendencies should <b>not
</b>be expanded to a totalitarian quasicultural system of symbolism,
used to <b>uniform</b> clothing, fashion, housing, etc., say, such as
black or black/red outfit and gear are seen as particularly anarchist
a.s.o.. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fascism may take on different forms dependent on the authoritarian
degree, populism included, i.e. <b>dark brown, brown and light brown</b>
systems respectively. To the left of the middle within the fascist
quadrant a slight tendency or dash of red, to the right of the middle
a slight tendency or dash of blue, may be accounted for.
<b>Brown-striped</b> similar to light brown tendencies has been used.
In Norwegian we often use the term brun (brown) møkk, “Møkk”
means, “excrements” “shit”, “shit-bag” &quot;muck&quot;
and/or ochlarch/ist. &quot;Rødbrun, bare brun og blåbrun &quot; is
used. The terms mean red-brown, = ultra-authoritarian marxists, bare
brun (only brown) = ultra-authoritarian fascists, and blåbrun,
blue-brown = ultra-authoritarian arch-conservative liberalists, all
of them brown shit/muck of different shades. Mørkebrun møkk,
dark-brown shit/muck, are used for ultra-fascists, that have more
than 75 % authoritarian degree. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually colors are, in addition to the <b>brown for authoritarian;
red for socialism</b> <b>or leftism </b>and <b>blue for liberalism,
capitalism or rightism</b>, plus dashes of <b>black for libertarian</b>.
Dashes of <b>green for environmental </b>management may be accounted
for. If about optimal, this policy is progressive, say, i.e. a red &amp;
black policy with green added, but environmental policy may also be
exaggerated and/or combined with authoritarian tendencies, and be
brown &amp; green, etc. In a similar way <b>pink for feminism</b> may
be used, combined with black/red for anarchofeminism, and the
opposite, with more or less brown, in case of matriarchy,
authoritarian feminism. A green color may also be used for kids, as
opposed to the grown up people. The anarchist youths also use the
special &quot;a in circle&quot; logo with a black flag, as opposed to
the usual black and red flag of grown up anarchists. 
</p>
<p>It must be mentioned that also some marxists, marxist syndicalists
included, may use a black &amp; red flag, to pose as libertarian to
cover up for marxist authoritarian tendencies and provoke. Say, the
marxist Sandinists in Nicaragua use a black and red flag, but not the
same as anarchists. Nazigroups posing as anarchists have used the
swastika in combination with red &amp; black flag to make chaos and
provoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further to the left outside the fascist quadrant, with more than
67% authoritarian degree on the map, we have still very much statism,
that may take on different forms, but without plutarchy. These
systems are red and brown. To the right with more than 67%
authoritarian degree, we have plutarchist/capitalist systems, without
signifcant statism, but very authoritarian forms of economical
plutarchy, i.e. blue and brown systems. Ultra-fascism on the EP-map,
may be called just brown or dark brown. As indicated above,
ultra-authoritarian people is often called brown shit or shit-bags
and/or ochlarch/ists, to the left with red tendency added, and to the
right, blue added. There are ultra-authoritarian <b>ochlarchist</b>
marxists, fascists and arch-conservative liberalists, all of which
tend to develop into ultra-fascism. i.e. sometimes even into <b>killer
ochlarchs</b>. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light brown and brown tendencies with red to the left and blue to
the right are found between 50% authoritarian degree and 67%. They
are typically parliamentary, indirect democratic systems, with more
influence from the top downwards, than from the bottom upwards, i.e.
not real democracy/anarchist, and have a significant authoritarian
degree, but not totalitarian. More than 67% authoritarian degree,
totalitarian, means a dark brown system, with a dash of red to the
left of the middle, and a dash of blue to the right of the middle.
Close to the middleof the map, the colors are more pale/light.
Regarding fascist systems, a dash of red to the left and a dash of
blue to the right may be omitted, and with more than 67%
authoritarian degree we thus can use just dark brown for simplicity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As all fascist systems, including populist, are capitalist -
economical plutarchist - significant, they also may have a dash of
blue for capitalist. A left-populist system close to the middle of
the economic-political map is thus light brown, with a dash of red
and blue. For simplification just light brown and blue - or light
brown and red - may be used for such left-populist systems, dependent
on the situation. A left-populist system close to the totalitarian
but with less than 66,7% authoritarian degree is similar regarding
colors, but with brown, not light brown as the main color. A
right-populist system, close to the middle of the map, is light brown
and with a dash of blue, and never with a dash of red. Similar for a
right-populist system close to the totalitarian, and with less than
66,7% authoritarian degree, but with brown, not light brown as the
main color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With less than 50% authoritarian degree, outside the anarchist
quadrant, we find semilibertarian, also called semidemocratic,
systems, to the left, i.e. red without brown, and to the right, blue
without brown, and more pale/light towards the middle. Close to the
anarchist border violet may be used for semilibertarian
plutarchy/capitalism, and purple may be used for semilibertarian
marxism. <b>The anarchist systems are associated with red &amp; black
and black flags and banners, and green has been added in an
environmental context, and pink for feminism. A red background with
black stars, or black background with red stars, has also been used.
The black star is the official symbol of the International Anarchist
Tribunal. Alone, or together with a red shadow, it means anarchism. </b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are today the main uses of colors a.s.o. related to the
economical-political map and are decided by general consent by the
Anarchist International and IIFOR at several International
Congresses. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In addition to this <b>yellow</b> has sometimes been used
politically as symbol for treason, an authoritarian tendency, used as
swearword for people/organizations/systems turning to be more than
67% authoritarian , or turning from socialism to capitalism. This may
be taken into account on the map, say, as yellow stripes, together
with the relevant basic colors mentioned above. Yellow has also been
used for &quot;pest and plague&quot;, and could thus also be used to
indicate <b>ochlarchical tendencies</b>. Furthermore yellow has been
used to indicate <b>rule by priests, hierarchy</b> in the original
meaning. <b>Rainbow flags</b> have been used by different groups,
sometimes as symbol for <b>pluralism and colorful fellowship</b>.
This may be combined with the basic colors if relevant. Other colors
and symbols may of course also be introduced as stripes or other
signs in special cases, but generally speaking the basic colors
mentioned above are what is going to be used without further
explanation at the AIIS web-pages. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To have a consistent and firm use of the colors, may as indicated
above be a useful tool, pedagogically and didactically. Although
principally other colors may be used, the mentioned colors and use
have a historical context. The practice mentioned above also rejects
the use of black as color for unlawful, criminal and fascist
tendencies, which is inconsistent with the above approach, and only
make confusion. Inconsistencies are not pedagogical and scientifical,
and should be avoided. Say, <b>&quot;black&quot; market</b> for
criminal business should not be used, but &quot;brown &amp; blue plus
yellow&quot; for illegal capitalist markets, and &quot;brown &amp;
red plus yellow&quot; for corruption in marxist regimes, or just
<b>brown</b> <b>markets </b>instead. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These choices of colors are as mentioned related to historical
practice. To put something more into it, say, red for blood, black
for earth, brown for dirt, blue for sky, etc, or more metaphorical;
red for freedom, black for sorrow or land, etc. is not relevant in
this context, as the colors here are used in a nomothetical
perspective, and it is thus not very interesting to try to trace the
historical origins, if any particular reasons exists for the choices
of color at all. Perhaps these origins are quite random, more or less
a function of what is already &quot;occupied&quot;, and a need to
find something else, not to be mixed up with other political
tendencies or other problems.)</p>
