</p>
<h3 class="western"> Brief evaluation of e-commerce needs </h3>
<p>The following questions will help gather essential information about the client's needs and facilitate the design of a tailored e-commerce solution.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Membership Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Are you considering implementing a membership system for your
customers? If so, what benefits or features do you envision offering
to members?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Differentiated Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Will you require differentiated pricing structures for members
versus non-members? How do you anticipate managing these pricing
tiers?</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Product Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Do your products involve complex attributes or configurations
beyond standard categories, such as clothing? Could you provide
examples of the types of attributes that are important for your
offerings?</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Brand Representation</strong></p>
<p>Do you exclusively offer products from a single brand, or do you
represent multiple brands? How does this influence your e-commerce
strategy?</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Business Model Clarification</strong></p>
<p>Can you clarify your business model? Are you primarily a retail
store, a wholesaler offering bulk products to retail and or
individual customers, a representative of one or more brands, or do
you encompass a combination of these roles?</p>
