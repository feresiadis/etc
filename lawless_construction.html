construction of residences outside the city plan, especially when
lacking essential public infrastructure like pavements, proper roads,
public drainage, and wells, poses significant risks to both the
<strong>environment</strong> and the <strong>public budget</strong>.
Here's an in-depth look at how:</p>
<h3 class="western">a) <strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Deforestation and Habitat Loss</strong>: When
	residences are constructed arbitrarily outside the city plan, they
	often involve clearing natural vegetation, including forests,
	wetlands, or agricultural land. This deforestation leads to the
	destruction of local ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and
	disruption of wildlife habitats.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Soil Degradation and Erosion</strong>: The absence of
	proper infrastructure like roads and drainage systems can cause
	significant soil erosion. Without a planned layout for drainage,
	water from rains or storms can run off uncontrollably, washing away
	topsoil and leaving the land less fertile or prone to landslides in
	hilly areas. Additionally, unplanned construction often fails to
	implement erosion control measures, exacerbating the problem.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Water Contamination</strong>: Inadequate public
	drainage and the absence of proper sewage systems increase the
	likelihood of water pollution. Wastewater from homes may seep into
	groundwater or nearby rivers and streams, contaminating the local
	water supply. The lack of wells or improperly dug wells can lead to
	a scarcity of clean water, while reliance on septic systems without
	public oversight can lead to pollution of aquifers.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Increased Carbon Footprint</strong>: Arbitrary
	residential development can lead to longer commutes, as people
	living outside planned areas often have limited access to public
	transportation. As a result, residents are more likely to rely on
	private vehicles, which contributes to increased carbon emissions.
	Additionally, homes built without regard for energy-efficient
	designs or resources contribute to overall higher energy
	consumption.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Disruption of Natural Water Flow</strong>: Unplanned
	constructions can interfere with natural drainage patterns,
	wetlands, and watersheds, leading to flooding or water stagnation.
	Without public drainage infrastructure, runoff can flood homes or
	create waterlogged areas, leading to the breeding of mosquitoes and
	other pests.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Urban Sprawl</strong>: Arbitrary construction
	accelerates urban sprawl, where low-density, uncoordinated housing
	stretches far from the city core. This phenomenon not only fragments
	habitats but also consumes more land for fewer people, reducing the
	efficiency of land use and exacerbating environmental degradation.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="western">b) <strong>Public Budget Impact</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Cost of Retrofitting Infrastructure</strong>: When
	homes are built without adhering to a city plan, the local
	government often ends up facing high costs to extend or retrofit
	essential infrastructure like roads, pavements, drainage systems,
	and water lines. This process is far more expensive and
	time-consuming than if the infrastructure had been installed as part
	of a coordinated, planned development.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Emergency Services Strain</strong>: Residences built
	in unplanned areas may be hard to reach for emergency services like
	ambulances, fire trucks, and police. Providing access to these
	remote or irregularly built areas often requires additional funding
	to expand or improve emergency service routes, placing further
	strain on the public budget.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Increased Maintenance Costs</strong>: Improperly
	designed roads and drainage systems lead to faster wear and tear.
	The cost to maintain or repair these unplanned infrastructures can
	be significant. Additionally, the government might have to allocate
	resources for continuous repairs to patchwork infrastructure that
	doesn’t meet standard codes, creating a cycle of spending on
	temporary fixes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Public Health Costs</strong>: The absence of proper
	sewage and drainage systems can lead to the spread of diseases such
	as cholera, typhoid, or malaria (especially if water stagnates and
	breeds mosquitoes). The lack of access to clean water also
	exacerbates public health crises. Increased illness due to
	environmental degradation places a financial burden on public
	healthcare systems, requiring greater investment in medical services
	and disease control measures.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Cost of Legal and Regulatory Enforcement</strong>:
	Governments often need to invest significant resources in legal and
	regulatory efforts to address or mitigate unregulated construction.
	Enforcement agencies must monitor and attempt to stop unauthorized
	building, and after-the-fact regularization efforts can become
	bureaucratically complex and financially draining.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Burden on Public Utilities</strong>: Unplanned
	residential areas often create problems for the efficient delivery
	of public utilities like water, electricity, and waste management.
	Extending these services to outlying, arbitrary developments
	increases the cost of installation, and the irregular layout of
	these neighborhoods can make it inefficient to deliver services.
	This inefficiency leads to higher operational costs for public
	utility providers, which may eventually be passed on to taxpayers.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Decreased Property Value and Tax Revenues</strong>:
	Unregulated residential developments often do not follow building
	codes or safety standards, which can reduce the overall quality of
	life and lead to a decrease in property values. Lower property
	values in turn reduce the potential tax revenue that municipalities
	could generate, making it harder for local governments to invest in
	other necessary services and infrastructure upgrades.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Increased Infrastructure Inequality</strong>: The
	focus on retrofitting unplanned developments with essential
	infrastructure often diverts funds from planned urban areas, leading
	to inequality in infrastructure quality. This can lead to public
	dissatisfaction, as residents in planned areas might feel they are
	subsidizing the costs of unplanned construction, thus putting
	pressure on public budgets to address both areas simultaneously.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="western">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unplanned, arbitrary residential construction outside of a city’s
plan creates significant dangers both environmentally and
financially. For the environment, it exacerbates habitat destruction,
soil erosion, and water pollution, while increasing carbon emissions
and disrupting ecosystems. For the public budget, it leads to high
costs in retrofitting infrastructure, maintaining substandard
developments, providing emergency services, and addressing public
health concerns. Preventing such arbitrary construction is crucial
for both sustainable urban development and long-term financial
responsibility.</p>
<p>When a government retrospectively legalizes arbitrary construction
of residences, it sets a precedent that encourages a <strong>cunning
mentality</strong> among builders and developers, while providing
significant financial advantages to those who engage in this
practice. Here’s an in-depth breakdown of how this situation
unfolds:</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>1. Encouragement of a Cunning Mentality</strong></h3>
<p>Legalizing illegal constructions after the fact sends a message
that the government will tolerate violations of urban planning
regulations, as long as the violators are willing to pay a
legalization fee. This undermines the rule of law and creates a
mentality where individuals and developers feel emboldened to break
the rules deliberately. Here’s how this cunning mentality
manifests:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Calculation over Compliance</strong>: Instead of
	following legal procedures and city planning regulations, developers
	and individuals may begin to calculate the costs and benefits of
	breaking the law, factoring in the eventual legalization fee as a
	manageable expense. They recognize that they can build without
	adhering to zoning laws, knowing they’ll have an opportunity to
	legalize the property later, thus avoiding the more expensive and
	time-consuming process of obtaining permits and building according
	to regulations upfront.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Exploitation of Loopholes</strong>: Developers will
	actively exploit the system, building in areas where construction
	may be restricted or where public infrastructure is lacking. They
	know that even if the law is violated initially, they can pay a fine
	or fee later to make the property legal. This gaming of the system
	diminishes the authority of urban planning bodies and creates an
	environment where rules are seen as flexible, rather than binding.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Erosion of Trust in Institutions</strong>: This
	practice leads to a loss of trust in government institutions that
	are supposed to enforce urban regulations. Citizens may perceive the
	government as complicit in allowing lawbreakers to benefit
	financially from illegal activity. It can create an &quot;anything
	goes&quot; attitude where breaking the rules is not seen as risky
	but rather a shortcut to profits.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Disincentive for Lawful Builders</strong>: Legal
	builders who adhere to zoning regulations, pay for permits, and
	follow the city’s construction guidelines may feel penalized for
	complying with the law. Seeing others flout the rules and later
	legalize their properties without major consequences discourages
	ethical business practices and fosters a belief that following the
	law puts one at a financial disadvantage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><strong>2. Benefits to Perpetrators Who Sell
Arbitrary Property</strong></h3>
<p>The process of retrospective legalization offers substantial
benefits to perpetrators who construct or sell properties illegally.
Here’s how they profit:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Increased Property Value</strong>: Once an illegal
	construction is legalized, it gains legitimacy in the eyes of
	potential buyers, lenders, and investors. This legalization can
	substantially raise the property’s market value, especially in
	high-demand areas. The perpetrator can sell the property at a higher
	price than if it were illegal, often turning a significant profit
	compared to the original investment.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Minimal Initial Costs</strong>: Arbitrary
	construction often allows perpetrators to bypass initial costs that
	would normally be associated with legal building practices, such as
	obtaining permits, hiring architects to ensure compliance with
	building codes, or adhering to zoning laws. By cutting corners, the
	perpetrator reduces upfront expenses. The legalization fee, which
	comes later, is typically less costly than the combined expense of
	building legally from the start.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Circumvention of Building Standards</strong>:
	Properties constructed outside the legal framework often ignore city
	planning standards related to building safety, design, environmental
	impact, or public infrastructure. By cutting costs on these
	essential aspects, perpetrators save significant amounts of money
	during the construction phase. Once legalized, these properties
	enter the market without ever having had to meet stringent safety or
	environmental regulations, further increasing profit margins.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Rapid Sales in High-Demand Markets</strong>: In
	markets with high demand for housing, buyers may overlook the
	previous illegality of a property if it has since been legalized.
	The buyer might be unaware of or unconcerned with the long-term
	problems that could arise from the property’s original
	non-compliance with urban planning regulations (e.g., lack of proper
	infrastructure, unsafe construction). This allows the perpetrator to
	sell the property quickly and profitably.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Profit from Legalization Cost Transfer</strong>:
	Perpetrators can incorporate the cost of the eventual legalization
	fee into the overall selling price of the property. For example, if
	the legalization fee is relatively small compared to the potential
	profit from selling a newly legalized residence, they can add this
	fee to the final sale price. In this way, the perpetrator doesn’t
	actually lose anything from the legalization process, as the buyer
	essentially covers the cost.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Market Manipulation</strong>: Over time, perpetrators
	can create artificial scarcity in certain areas by saturating the
	market with these illegally constructed homes. This increases
	property values in areas where there may be few housing options,
	thus allowing them to sell at premium prices once legalization
	occurs. By circumventing zoning laws that might restrict dense
	development, they can profit from areas that would otherwise have
	seen limited construction.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Reinforcement of the Business Model</strong>: Once a
	developer successfully legalizes arbitrary construction and profits
	from the sale, they’re likely to repeat the process. Each
	successful transaction reinforces the business model of building
	first, then legalizing later, thus perpetuating the cycle of
	unregulated, unplanned urban growth. The profitability of the scheme
	encourages more people to adopt the same strategy, exacerbating the
	problem over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Wider Consequences</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Urban Chaos and Inequality</strong>: Retrospectively
	legalizing unplanned constructions leads to disorganized urban
	development. As a result, neighborhoods lacking essential services
	like drainage, roads, and public spaces may emerge. Over time, these
	areas can become underdeveloped or even slum-like, despite being
	legally recognized. This creates a stark divide in cities, where
	some neighborhoods enjoy full infrastructure while others are left
	neglected, deepening urban inequality.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Long-term Financial Burden on Buyers</strong>: Buyers
	of these properties may initially be attracted by lower prices or
	desirable locations, but they could face significant long-term
	costs. These might include upgrading the property to meet
	infrastructure needs, or dealing with ongoing issues such as poor
	drainage, traffic congestion, or safety concerns. While the original
	perpetrators profit, the buyers inherit the challenges created by
	the property’s unplanned nature.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Increased Strain on Public Resources</strong>: As
	more properties are retroactively legalized, the government must
	extend public services like roads, sewage systems, and water
	supplies to areas outside the original urban plan. This places a
	heavy financial burden on the public budget, often requiring the
	diversion of taxpayer money from other essential services. Over
	time, this strains public infrastructure and increases costs for
	municipalities.</p></li>
</ol>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The retrospective legalization of arbitrary constructions benefits
perpetrators by allowing them to maximize profits while bypassing the
legal and financial responsibilities that normally accompany real
estate development. It fosters a cunning mentality that undermines
urban planning regulations and encourages others to flout the rules,
knowing they can legalize their actions later. In the long term, this
practice creates chaotic urban development, increases inequality, and
places additional strain on public infrastructure and budgets. 
</p>
<p>A government that legalizes lawless constructions for the purpose
of canvassing in elections could be described as <strong>populist</strong>
or <strong>opportunistic</strong>. These terms highlight how the
government may prioritize short-term political gains over long-term
governance and legal integrity. This approach can also be seen as
<strong>pandering</strong> to a specific voter base or <strong>clientelistic</strong>,
where the government uses policy decisions to win favor with certain
groups in exchange for political support.</p>
<p>In some contexts, such actions might be viewed as <strong>corrupt</strong>
or <strong>unprincipled</strong>, especially if they undermine legal
frameworks and urban planning for electoral gain. The term <strong>electoral
opportunism</strong> might also apply, emphasizing the use of public
policies as a tool to manipulate or attract voters during election
campaigns.</p>
