    <title>History Reflection - October 28th and Political Turmoil in Greece</title>

    <h1>Reflection on October 28th and the Figure of Ioannis Metaxas</h1>
    <p>On the occasion of the national celebration of October 28th, marking Greece's entry into World War II, it is fitting to reflect on the figure of fascist dictator Ioannis Metaxas.</p>

    <h2>The Dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas</h2>
    <p>The dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas in Greece, which began on August 4, 1936, was established under the pretext of averting a communist threat and restoring social order. Metaxas, 
    a former general and monarchist, argued that Greece was on the brink of a communist uprising fueled by labor unrest, political instability, and a struggling economy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Ioannis Metaxas did not overthrow an existing government through a coup; rather, he gradually consolidated power under legal circumstances, eventually establishing an authoritarian regime 
    with the support of the military. Here’s the context:</strong></p>
    
    <p>In April 1936, Metaxas was appointed Prime Minister by King George II following the death of the sitting Prime Minister, Konstantinos Demertzis. Metaxas was initially chosen due to his support 
    for the monarchy, amid a period of political instability and a fragmented parliament.</p>
    
    <p>The political situation became more critical in the following months. On August 4, 1936, citing the need to restore social order and prevent a supposed communist threat, Metaxas persuaded 
    King George II to declare a state of emergency. The king, who was supportive of Metaxas’s strong anti-communist stance, granted him emergency powers. Metaxas then dissolved the parliament, 
    banned political parties, and suspended various constitutional freedoms, effectively establishing a dictatorship.</p>
    
    <p>Thus, Metaxas did not overthrow an existing government in a violent coup; instead, he was appointed legally as Prime Minister and then used the political crisis and the king's support 
    to transform his position into that of an authoritarian ruler. This marked the beginning of the "4th of August Regime," which lasted until his death in January 1941.</p>

    <h2>Revisiting the Centre Union and the 1967 Coup</h2>
    <p><strong>Furthermore, in light of the recent efforts to cast the government of the Centre Union in a negative light—a government that was forcibly overthrown by the military junta in 1967—and 
    to recreate the recent past, it's worth revisiting the history of those tumultuous days.</strong> What follows is a brief account of that period, shedding light on the events and context surrounding 
    the Centre Union's time in power and the subsequent coup that reshaped Hellas's course.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Centre Union</strong> was not a communist party. In fact, it was a centrist, reformist political party that <strong>sought to challenge both the far-right establishment and the influence 
    of the communist left, advocating for a middle path between these extremes and political-economic decentralization.</strong>The party's efforts to reform the political and economic system 
    and address social inequalities gained significant support, but also intensified tensions in the polarized political environment of 1960s Greece.</p>
    
    <h3>Context Leading to the 1967 Coup</h3>
    <p>To understand the context of the junta's intervention, it's important to look at the period leading up to the 1967 coup:</p>
    
    <p>Post-World War II Greece had experienced a brutal civil war (1946-1949), which left deep divisions between the right (including royalists and anti-communists) and the left 
    (including communists and socialist sympathizers). <strong>After the civil war, right-wing governments dominated Greek politics, supported by the military and monarchy.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The Centre Union emerged in the early 1960s as a reformist, anti-establishment alternative to both the conservative National Radical Union (ERE) and the far-left. 
    Under George Papandreou, the party gained popularity by promising political, economic, and social reforms, anti-corruption measures, and a more independent foreign policy. 
    <strong>The Centre Union sought to challenge the entrenched power structures of the conservative establishment while distancing itself from the communist movement.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The political crisis that led to the coup had its roots in the so-called <strong>"Apostasy" of 1965.</strong> After winning the 1964 election by a wide margin, George Papandreou's government 
    faced resistance from the conservative establishment, including the monarchy. The monarchy in Greece had a more active and influential role in politics 
    than in many other Western countries, where constitutional monarchies are symbolic. Tensions peaked when King Constantine II <strong>dismissed Papandreou over a dispute about who would control 
    the Ministry of Defence.</strong> This dismissal, known as the "Apostasy," led to the defection of several Centre Union deputies and the formation of unstable governments backed by the king 
    and conservative forces.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Centre Union</strong>, while not communist, was perceived as a threat by the military and right-wing establishment because it aimed to reduce the military's influence in politics 
    and curtail the monarchy's power. The <strong>political struggle was thus not just about ideology but about the structure and control of power in the country.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>The junta argued oxymoronically that an anarchist perception was infiltrating society, posing a direct threat for the country to be conquered by communism.</strong>

    <h3>The Military Coup of April 21, 1967</h3>
    <p>The military coup led by the "Junta of the Colonels" in Greece occurred on April 21, 1967, just weeks before scheduled parliamentary elections. 
    The junta justified the overthrow of the elected government of the Centre Union and the suspension of democratic institutions. 
    <strong>In reality, the junta feared</strong> the potential electoral victory of the Centre Union or a coalition government that might include leftist elements. 
    <strong>The Centre Union was poised to win the upcoming elections</strong>, and the junta saw this as a threat to the conservative order and the influence of the military in political life. 
    <strong>The coup was, therefore, less about saving Greece from a communist uprising and more about preempting a real democratic = anarchist shift that could diminish the military's 
    and the monarchy's roles in governance.</strong></p>
