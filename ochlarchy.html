About the &quot;Minor incidents&quot; at night, when a marxist mob
threw 20 Molotov cocktails at police officers (MAT i.e. the Riot
Police Units) There were 14 arrests, and all those detained were
released!!!</font></font></p>

because the mob's lawyers and the prosecution are really tough <b>maroon
fascists (red-brown) or left fascists or ultra-authoritarian marxists</b>,
making the symbolic Presidency really proud of their &quot;gang
initiation&quot; type of achievement. In other words: It appears that
the actions of the lawyers representing the group, along with the
prosecution's stance, reflect a rigid and extreme approach, which
seems to align with their ideological leanings. This behaviour might
be perceived as contributing to the symbolic approval of such
activities by certain institutional authorities.</font></font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">It
is well-documented that over half of the police force has
historically supported the neo-Nazi party&nbsp;Golden Dawn = <b>ultra
fascists = deep dark brown fascists (brack)</b>. Additionally, it is
known that many individuals involved in mobs throwing Molotov
cocktails are related to&nbsp;<b>maroon fascists (red-brown) or left
fascists or ultra-authoritarian marxists</b> MPs. Historically, some
of these ultra authoritarian agitators have gone on to become MPs
themselves, after having occupied public spaces such as schools and
universities. A prominent example is Greeceâ€™s bankrupted state
former Prime Minister, A. Tsipras, who has led such left-fascist
movements. Another example is the leadership of neo-Nazi party Golden
Dawn, now imprisoned as a criminal organisation. This pattern of
encouraging rival extremists to engage in violent acts, followed by
their release by prosecutors, perpetuates populist = fascist
sentiments. If the country were to ever establish a progressive
centrist government = liberal social-democrat, there is a risk that
opposing mobs dominated by extremist could once again threaten the
integrity of the parliament through ochlarchy i.e. mob rule broadly
defined.</font></font></p>

of Trust in Democratic Institutions:</b> When law enforcement
agencies are perceived as aligning with extremist ideologies, such as
&quot;maroon&quot; and &quot;brack&quot; ultra-authoritarian mobs,
public trust in their neutrality and role as protectors of democracy
is undermined. This perception can lead to a loss of confidence in

of Violence and Extremism:</b> The repeated engagement of rival
extremists in violent acts, coupled with the lack of accountability
(e.g., being released by prosecutors as it always happens in Hellas),
can normalize such behaviour. This diminishes the stigma associated
with political violence and may embolden more individuals or groups
to resort to such tactics to achieve their aims, further
destabilizing the democratic
process.</font></font></p>

optimal order and law = Anarchy = Real Democracy</b>: When
individuals or groups committing violent acts are not held
accountable, it suggests that certain people are above the law. This
undermines the principle of equality before the law, a cornerstone of
democratic societies, and can lead to a perception of selective
justice, where extremist actions are tolerated or even indirectly
encouraged.</font></font></p>

to Parliamentary Integrity:</b></font></font><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
If extremist groups gain political power, either through violence,
populist = fascist tactics, or exploiting public disillusionment,
they may use their influence to undermine parliamentary processes.
For example, they might disrupt parliamentary and municipal sessions,
intimidate political opponents, or</font></font> <font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">push
undemocratic i.e. authoritarian policies through. Such actions can
erode the parliamentarian and municipal liberty to function

The presence of extremist factions on the left and the right of the
political spectrum (see the </font></font><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>Economic-Political</b></font></font><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">

can lead to increased polarization. As the political centre weakens,
it becomes harder to build consensus and enact economic policies that
reflect the interests of the broader population i.e. the People
grass-roots Bottom to Top. This polarization can create a cycle of
extremism, where each side becomes more extreme in response to
perceived threats from the other, </font></font><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>and
potentially even engage in a power game in strategic collusion</b></font></font><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">.</font></font></p>
<h3 class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>Erosion
of Democratic Perception and Mindset:</b> When extremist ideologies
become embedded in mainstream politics or are perceived as being
tolerated by the law, it erodes the democratic mindset of the
citizenry. Real Democracy = Anarchy means optimal order and law,
reasoned discourse and the legitimacy of diverse opinions. If
violence and authoritarianism are seen as viable political tools, the
foundations are weakened, leading to a more hostile and fragmented
society.</font></font></h3>

for Ochlarchy (i.e. Mob-Rule broadly defined):</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">The
risk arises when extremist groups, use ochlarchy i.e. mob rule

disrupt Bottom to Top democratic processes, and potentially lead to
authoritarian responses, further degrading democracy to the point
that&nbsp;the system may collapse into chaos, the opposite of anarchy
and anarchism, i. e. real democracy. Chaos is typically ochlarchy
with rivaling polyarchy, dominated by extremists, and perhaps later
call for a &quot;strong man&quot; and a totalitarian dictatorship, as
it happened already in Hellas in 1967 when the marxist and
nationalist riots forced a junta of colonels to overthrow the
